[Chatbot for Ordering Starbucks](https://bot.dialogflow.com/069e7547-b6c7-435b-b881-c276edce665c)

# Overview:
This is an attempt to create a no-code chatbot for ordering coffee from Starbucks using Google Dialogflow. The chatbot starts by asking the user for a six-digit pincode to locate the nearest store, and proceeds to ask three things asked by employees at almost all Starbucks outlets: the size of the drink, the name of the drink, and if the customer would like the beverage hot or cold.
